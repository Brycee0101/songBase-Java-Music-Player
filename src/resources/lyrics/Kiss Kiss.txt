Okay
Get me out of this house, and get me out of my head
Get me a drink and a cigarette
I just need to go out 'cause I can sleep when I'm dead
Drop me off at The Rox on Sunset
Hey, you, same time and the same place
We can get shitfaced, yeah-yeah
Hey, you, there's a lot that I wanna say
But that's for another day, okay
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle, yeah
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Hello, goodbye
Uh, let's get back in the car, it's time to do it again
Light up a blunt and a cigarette (let's go)
I went back in the bar and told her bring all her friends
I don't even know where we're going yet
Hey, you, same time and the same place
We can get shitfaced, yeah-yeah
Hey, you, there's a lot that I wanna say
But that's for another day, okay
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle, yeah
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Hello, goodbye
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle, yeah
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Hello, goodbye
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle, yeah
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle, yeah
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Hello, goodbye
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss the bottle all night
Hello, goodbye, yeah
Goodbye, yeah
